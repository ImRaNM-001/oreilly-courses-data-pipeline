#### Astro Runtime includes the following pre-installed providers packages: https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/runtime-image-architecture#provider-packages


The command `astro dev init` is part of the Astronomer CLI, which is used to set up and manage Astronomer projects that utilize Apache Airflow. When you run `astro dev init`, it initializes a new Astronomer project in the current directory, and one of the actions it performs is to create a `packages.txt` file.

### Purpose of `packages.txt`

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - The `packages.txt` file is used to specify the Python packages that your Airflow project depends on. This file is particularly useful for defining additional Python packages that are not included in the default Airflow installation.

2. **Custom Packages**:
   - If your Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) require specific libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, or any other third-party libraries), you can list them in `packages.txt`. This allows Astronomer to install these packages in the Docker image that runs your Airflow instance.

3. **Docker Integration**:
   - When you deploy your Astronomer project, the contents of `packages.txt` are used to build the Docker image for your Airflow deployment. This ensures that all necessary dependencies are included in the environment where your DAGs will run.

### Example of `packages.txt`

A typical `packages.txt` file might look like this:

```
pandas==1.3.3
numpy==1.21.2
requests==2.26.0
```

### Summary

- **Created by `astro dev init`**: The `packages.txt` file is generated when you initialize a new Astronomer project.
- **Purpose**: It is used to specify additional Python dependencies required for your Airflow project, ensuring that these packages are installed in the Docker environment where your Airflow instance runs.

By managing your dependencies in `packages.txt`, you can ensure that your Airflow environment is properly configured with all the necessary libraries for your workflows.
